# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to learn the basics of coding. I built this study guide webpage to better understand what it took to create a webpage. It solves the issue of me being completely new to this subject. I learned the core basics for creating a webpage and look forward to learning more.

This prework guide can be used for many different things. For starters it gives you the main bullet points for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. Also we can now go back and look at all the steps that it took to create this webpage. It perfectly lists out every topic from the prework and allows us to better study them.
